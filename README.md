# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes. By leveraging a neural network, the model analyzes various health metrics to provide accurate predictions, assisting in early diagnosis and prevention. The project utilizes the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains 14 features such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and other clinical measurements.
